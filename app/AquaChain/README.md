Based on the code, the PhotoVerifier module performs a comprehensive set of checks to determine the authenticity, quality, and relevance of an image. Here is a detailed breakdown of all the checks it performs:

1. Photo Batch and Overall Checks
Minimum Photos Required: The script first checks if the number of submitted photos meets the minimum requirement, which is set to 3. If not, the entire batch is rejected immediately.

Overall Authenticity Score: For each valid photo, the script calculates a single authenticity score based on a weighted average of all other checks.

Final Batch Status: The final status of the batch (APPROVED or REJECTED) is determined by comparing the overall verification score to the AUTHENTICITY_THRESHOLD (set to 0.7).

2. Individual Photo Checks
Content Validation
This check ensures that the image contains elements of a coastal ecosystem, not a manufactured or indoor environment.

Vegetation Detection: It identifies and calculates the percentage of green areas in the image using HSV color ranges.

Water Detection: It identifies and calculates the percentage of blue areas to confirm the presence of water.

Sand/Soil Detection: It identifies and calculates the percentage of brown and tan areas, a key indicator of a beach or coastal habitat.

Human Face Detection: It uses a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to check for human faces, penalizing the score if faces are a major element of the photo.

Text/Document Detection: It uses morphological operations to detect significant regions of text, such as a document or a screen, which would indicate the photo is not of a natural landscape.

Indoor Element Detection: It looks for telltale signs of an indoor environment, like a high number of parallel and perpendicular lines (suggesting walls or furniture) or large, uniform, low-saturation regions (suggesting painted walls).

Image Manipulation
This section uses multiple techniques to identify any signs that the photo has been altered.

Error Level Analysis (ELA): It re-compresses the image and compares it to the original. Differences in areas with different compression levels can reveal regions that have been added or edited.

Noise Consistency Check: It analyzes the noise levels across different parts of the image. Inconsistency in noise patterns can be a sign of image manipulation, as different parts of the image may have come from different sources.

Copy-Paste Detection: It samples small patches of the image and searches for identical or near-identical duplicates, which could indicate a copied and pasted object.

Screen Detection
This check is designed to prevent a user from submitting a photo of a photo on a screen, which could be a form of fraud.

FFT Analysis: It uses a Fast Fourier Transform to look for regular frequency patterns, such as those caused by a screen's pixel grid or refresh rate.

Moir√© Pattern Detection: It looks for rectangular patterns and sharp edges, which could be the bezels of a screen.

Reflection Detection: It analyzes the image for bright spots and glare that are typical of a photo taken of a reflective screen.

Image Quality
This ensures that the image is of sufficient quality for analysis.

Resolution: It checks if the image's dimensions meet a minimum resolution requirement (set to 800x600).

Blur Detection: It uses the Laplacian variance method to measure blurriness. A score below the BLUR_THRESHOLD indicates a blurry image.

Brightness/Darkness: It calculates the mean brightness of the image to check if it's too dark or overexposed.

Contrast: It measures the contrast of the image, with low contrast resulting in a lower score.

Metadata and Duplication
This group of checks analyzes the file itself for consistency and originality.

EXIF Data Check: It attempts to extract metadata, including the camera model, make, timestamp, and GPS coordinates.

GPS Verification: It checks for the presence of valid GPS latitude and longitude data.

Timestamp Recency: It verifies that the photo's timestamp is recent (within 24 hours of submission).

Duplicate Check: It uses a perceptual hashing algorithm to generate a unique hash for each photo and compares it to a list of hashes from previously seen images to detect if a photo has been submitted more than once.
